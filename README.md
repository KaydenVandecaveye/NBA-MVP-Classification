NBA-MVP-Classification Project Description:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an NBA player will be an MVP candidate and estimate their ranking among MVP candidates based on their performance statistics.

Web Scrape Historic NBA Data:

First, I will web scrape historic NBA player, MVP, and standings data from Basketball Reference using the Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium libraries in Python. BeautifulSoup and Selenium will be used to extract the necessary data, while Pandas will facilitate data manipulation.

Clean Historic NBA Data:

Second, I will clean and merge the scraped data into a single DataFrame to ensure it is usable for training a machine learning model. This step will involve handling missing values, normalizing statistics, and ensuring consistency across different datasets.

Train Machine Learning Model:

Third, I will train machine learning models, specifically ridge regression and random forest, to predict the "share" of MVP votes a player will receive based on their statistics. The "share" value will also be used to predict a player's rank in MVP voting. These models are chosen for their respective strengths in handling multicollinearity and providing interpretability.

Evaluate Model Performance:

Fourth, I will evaluate the models' performance using precision as an initial metric. I will also consider other metrics, such as recall and mean absolute error, to assess both the detection of MVP candidacy and the accuracy of ranking predictions. Analyzing feature importance will also be a part of this evaluation.

Iterate Over Steps 4 and 5:

Finally, I will iterate over the model training and evaluation steps. This process includes testing accuracy, modifying model parameters, and potentially exploring additional models to improve performance. This iterative process will continue until the model meets a satisfactory level of accuracy and reliability.
Successfully predicting MVP candidacy will provide valuable insights into the key factors that contribute to a player's recognition as an MVP, offering valuable information for teams, analysts, and fans.
